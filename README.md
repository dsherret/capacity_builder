# `capacity_builder`

Builders where the code to calculate the capacity is the same as the code to
write what's being built.

Note: This crate is early in development and only has a string builder.

## Overview

Sometimes you have some complex code that would be a bit of a pain to calculate
the capacity of or could risk easily getting out of sync with the
implementation. This crate makes keeping it in sync easier because it's the same
code.

```rs
use capacity_builder::StringBuilder;

let text = StringBuilder::build(|builder| {
  for (i, import_module) in import_modules.iter().enumerate() {
    builder.append("// ");
    builder.append(i);
    builder.append(" import\n");
    builder.append("import \"");
    builder.append(import_module);
    builder.append("\";\n");
  }
})?;
```

Behind the scenes it runs the closure once to compute the capacity and a second
time to write the string.

## Features

1. The builder prevents adding owned stringsâ€”only references.
   - This helps to prevent accidentally allocating strings multiple times in the
     closure.
1. Errors when capacity cannot be reserved.
1. Types other than string references can be provided.
   - Numbers get written with the [itoa](https://crates.io/crates/itoa) crate.

## Tips

- Do any necessary allocations before running the closure.
- Measure before and after using this crate to ensure you're not slower.
- Probably don't use this crate if computing the capacity is simple.
  - Though maybe it will create more maintainable code, so measure and see.
